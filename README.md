## XRides - Cab Services

The biggest challenge for XRides is to increase the utilization rate of their cabs. However, the
demand keeps fluctuating based on the area, time of day, etc. Your task is to device a
geo-surge strategy that would help them incentivize their drivers. Identify what areas and at
what times get most bookings and how would you increase the price in those areas in order to
meet the demand.
